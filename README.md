Introduction

This project was created by Cameron Lee for CS-340 Client Server/Development at Southern New Hampshire University. The goal is to provide an interactive Jupyter Dashboard displaying information about dogs in a database for an international rescue-animal training company named Grazioso Salvare.

The data table includes filters for breed, age, and preferred sex to identify dogs suitable for various rescue situations, such as Water Rescue, Mountain/Wilderness Rescue, and Disaster Relief.

Additionally, the dashboard features a reset option to clear filters. Below the data table, you'll find a real-time updating pie chart and map. The map displays the distribution of filtered dogs worldwide, pinpointing their locations and names.
